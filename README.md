## Project Structure
```
online-food-ordering-system/
â”œâ”€ src/com/ofos/         # Java source files
â”œâ”€ resources/            # SQL schema and sample data
â””â”€ README.md
```

## Setup

1. **Install MySQL** and create a database:
   - Database name: `ofos_db` (or change in `DBConnection.java`)

2. **Run SQL script** `resources/ofos_schema.sql` to create tables and sample data.
   ```sql
   -- from resources/ofos_schema.sql
   ```

3. **Edit DB credentials**
   - File: `src/com/ofos/DBConnection.java`
   - Update `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` as needed.

4. **Compile & Run**
   Using command line:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/com/ofos/*.java
   java -cp out com.ofos.Main
   ```
   Or import the project into your favorite IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) as a Java project.
